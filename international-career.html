      <h3>
        <u>Early Call-Up and Debut (Age 21)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Paulo Dybala’s journey with the Argentina national team began at the age
        of 21, when he received his first senior call-up in September 2015.
        <br />
        Although eligible to play for Italy or Poland through his ancestry,
        Dybala made it clear that he identified fully as Argentinian and would
        only represent Argentina internationally.
        <br />
        He made his official senior debut on October 13, 2015, coming on as a
        substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Paraguay.
        <br />
        At the time, he was emerging as one of Europe’s brightest young
        forwards, starring for Juventus in Serie A.

      <h3>
        <u>Competition for Spots and 2018 World Cup (Age 24)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Despite his immense talent, Dybala struggled to establish himself as a
        regular starter in the national team during his early years.
        <br />
        This was partly due to the depth of Argentina’s attacking talent and the
        difficulty coaches had in playing both Dybala and Lionel Messi in the
        same lineup.
        <br />
        He was selected for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia at age 24, but
        made just one appearance, coming off the bench during the group stage
        against Croatia.
        <br />
        Argentina exited the tournament in the Round of 16 after a loss to
        France.

      <h3>
        <u>Copa América 2019 – First Competitive Goal (Age 25)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Dybala's role became more prominent at the 2019 Copa América in Brazil.
        <br />
        At 25 years old, he featured more regularly and scored his first
        competitive goal for Argentina in the third-place playoff against Chile,
        helping secure a 2–1 win.
        <br />
        This was a breakthrough moment for him on the international stage,
        showing he could contribute in high-pressure matches.

      <h3>
        <u>Finalissima and Other Contributions (Age 26-27)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        In 2022, at age 26, Dybala played a key role in Argentina's victory in
        the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions (Finalissima) against Italy.
        <br />
        He scored the opening goal in a 3-0 win, showcasing his ability to
        perform in crucial matches.
        <br />
        Throughout this period, Dybala continued to be a valuable squad member,
        often coming off the bench to provide creativity and attacking options.
        <br />
        Over his career, he has also scored in international friendlies,
        including a goal against Mexico in 2018.

      <h3>
        <u>World Cup Glory – Qatar 2022 (Age 29)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The pinnacle of Dybala's international career came at the 2022 FIFA
        World Cup in Qatar, where he was part of the Argentina squad that won
        the tournament.
        <br />
        At 29 years old, Dybala played a significant role throughout the
        competition, often coming off the bench to make an impact.
        <br />
        He scored a crucial goal in the quarterfinal against the Netherlands,
        helping Argentina advance to the semifinals.
        <br />
        In the final against France, Dybala came on as a substitute and
        contributed to Argentina's victory in the penalty shootout, securing
        their third World Cup title.
        <br />
        Dybala earned his place in the nation’s football history as part of a
        World Cup–winning team.

      <h3>
        <u>Legacy and Role in the National Team (Age 30 and Beyond)</u>
      </h3>
      <p>
        While Paulo Dybala has never been the main star of the Argentina
        national team, largely due to the presence of Lionel Messi and a crowded
        attacking lineup, his career is a testament to patience,
        professionalism, and clutch performances.
        <br />
        Whether stepping up in the World Cup final shootout or scoring in key
        tournaments, Dybala has proven to be a valuable part of Argentina's
        golden era — contributing to victories in the Copa América, Finalissima,
        and World Cup.
