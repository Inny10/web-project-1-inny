        <h3>
            Early Call-Up and Debut (Age 21)
        </h3>
        <p>
        Paulo Dybala’s journey with the Argentina national team began at the age of 21, when he received his first senior call-up in September 2015.
        <br />
        Although eligible to play for Italy or Poland through his ancestry, Dybala made it clear that he identified fully as Argentinian and would only represent Argentina internationally.
        <br />
        He made his official senior debut on October 13, 2015, coming on as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Paraguay.
        <br />
        At the time, he was emerging as one of Europe’s brightest young forwards, starring for Juventus in Serie A.

        <h3>
            Competition for Spots and 2018 World Cup (Age 24)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Despite his immense talent, Dybala struggled to establish himself as a regular starter in the national team during his early years.
            <br />
            This was partly due to the depth of Argentina’s attacking talent and the difficulty coaches had in playing both Dybala and Lionel Messi in the same lineup.
            <br />
            He was selected for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia at age 24, but made just one appearance, coming off the bench during the group stage against Croatia.
            <br />
            Argentina exited the tournament in the Round of 16 after a loss to France.

        <h3>
            Copa América 2019 – First Competitive Goal (Age 25)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Dybala's role became more prominent at the 2019 Copa América in Brazil.
            <br />
            At 25 years old, he featured more regularly and scored his first competitive goal for Argentina in the third-place playoff against Chile, helping secure a 2–1 win.
            <br />
            This was a breakthrough moment for him on the international stage, showing he could contribute in high-pressure matches.
